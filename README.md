# Monty Hall Simulation and Simple Visualizations
The Monty Hall Problem is a classic problem within the Bayesian Statistics Realm. Solving this problem analytically with Bayes Rule can be confusion for those new to it, but the problem can be understood without it. Coding the problem definently helps those to understand better how switching instead of staying could result in a higher probability.

### Description of the Monty Hall Problem
Consider three doors. Behind one is a car. Behind the other two are goats. As a contestant on this show, you are allowed to choose one of the three doors (A, B, and C). You choose A. Monty Hall, the host, then removes door B. He also allows you to switch to door C or stay with door A. What do you do? Which option give you the best probability of getting the car and not a goat?
